# Building a little App with some ML as a Demo
This repo is supposed to become a simple demo of an application using REST API with Flask.
This app will propose to run inference on a trained machine learning model about a pretext problem.
A database will be accessible from the app with few example for the inference.

Modeling isn't the main focus here, it's just a pretext for developing a data and machine learning
approach integrated into a Flask REST API and with the availability of a queryable database.

Please be aware that this is an ongoing, unfinished project that began on September 16, 2023.
